	 * Checks that a line is valid between two configurations.

	 * 2. The	system	must	 form a	connected	chain at	all	 times.

	 * 3. The polygon  formed by connecting	 the two ends of the connected chain with a straight line segment must,	at	all	times,be convex	and	have an	area of at least	Ï€rmin2,	where	rmin =	0.007(n-1) and n is	the	number	of	ASVs.	
	 * 4. The brooms must never intersect with each	other.
5. Brooms	and	ASVs	must	never intersect	with	obstacles.
6. Brooms	&	ASVs	cannot	move	outside	the	[0,1]X[0,1]	workspace.
7. The	 planned	 path	 must	 be	 given	 as	 a	 sequence	 of	 positions	 (primitive
